1. Data Preprocessing
Develop algorithms to preprocess and clean the datastreams received from the Core Motion framework. Apply necessary filters or transformations to enhance the quality of the data.

2. Data collection and Datastream Integration
Integrate the Core Motion framework into the project to accept real-time datastreams. Set up appropriate sensors and motion tracking to capture relevant data.


3. Pattern Matching Algorithm Design
Design and implement the algorithms required for matching patterns against the existing datasets. 

4. Real-time Matching and Mapping
Implement the algorithms for real-time matching and mapping of data patterns. Ensure the matching process can handle the influx of data from the datastreams and provide quick and accurate results.
