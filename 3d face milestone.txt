
I have four milestones.

1. Facial recognition an tracking. (2 weeks)
- collect 10 image datasets(Hugging face site and so on)
- Training based on LSTM in python (Deep learning model, test mode)
2. Depth data processing.(2 weeks)
- collect large amount of image dataset (hugging face and other dataset site)
- Training based on LSTM model in python(using this data)
- Evaluation and fune-tune in python (using BERT-score algorithm)
- Testing
3. Design Smart UI.(1 week)
- Using C# or Jupyter (python)
- Capture the Video Frames: Use OpenCV to capture video frames from a webcam or any other video source.
4. Integration with model and GUI app.(3 weeks)
- Perform Real-Time Facial Recognition: Combine all the above steps to implement real-time facial recognition and tracking
- Refine and Optimize: Fine-tune the model parameters, adjust the tracking algorithms

To develop this project, I will use the Python(Deep learning, Jupyter) or C#->WPF UI(if you want)
